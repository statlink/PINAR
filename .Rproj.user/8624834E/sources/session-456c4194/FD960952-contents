\description{
Global optimization of the linearity test statistic for the Threshold Poisson
Network Autoregressive model of order \eqn{p} with \eqn{q} covariates
(T-PNAR(\eqn{p})) with respect to the nuisance threshold parameter \eqn{\gamma}.

\usage{
global_optimise_LM_tnarpq(gama_L = NULL, gama_U = NULL, len = 10, b, y, W,
p, d, Z = NULL, tol = 1e-9)
}

\arguments{
\item{gama_L}{
The lower value of the \eqn{\gamma} values to consider. If you do not know the
value leave it NULL and it will be computed internally. See the details for
information about default computation.
}
\item{gama_U}{
The upper value of the \eqn{\gamma} values to consider. If you do not know the
value leave it NULL and it will be computed internally. See the details for
information about default computation.
}
\item{len}{
The number of increments to consider for the \eqn{\gamma} parameter.
}
\item{b}{
The estimated parameters from the linear model, in the following order:
(intercept, network parameters, autoregressive parameters, covariates).
The dimension of the vector should be 2\code{p} + 1 + number of covariates.
}
\item{y}{
A \eqn{TT} x \eqn{N} time series object or a \eqn{TT} x \eqn{N} numerical matrix with the \eqn{N} multivariate
count time series over \eqn{TT} time periods.
}
\item{W}{
The \eqn{N} x \eqn{N} row-normalized non-negative adjacency matrix describing
the network. The main diagonal entries of the matrix should be zeros, all the
other entries should be non-negative and the maximum sum of elements over the
rows should equal one. The function row-normalizes the matrix if a non-normalized
adjacency matrix is provided.
}
\item{p}{
The number of lags in the model.
}
\item{d}{
The lag parameter of non-linear variable (should be between 1 and p).
}
\item{Z}{
An \eqn{N} x \eqn{q} matrix of covariates (one for each column), where \eqn{q}
is the number of covariates in the model. Note that they must be non-negative.
}
\item{tol}{
The tolerance level for the optimizer.
}
}

\details{
The function optimizes the quasi score test statistic, under the null assumption of linearity,
for testing linearity of Poisson Network Autoregressive model of order \eqn{p} against the following T-PNAR(\eqn{p})
model, with respect to the unknown nuisance parameter (\eqn{\gamma}). For each node of the network \eqn{i=1,...,N} over
the time sample \eqn{t=1,...,TT}
\deqn{
\lambda_{i,t}=\beta_{0}+\sum_{h=1}^{p}\beta_{1h}X_{i,t-h}+\beta_{2h}Y_{i,t-h}+(\alpha_{0}+\alpha_{1h}X_{i,t-h}
+\alpha_{2h}Y_{i,t-h})I(X_{i,t-d}\leq\gamma)+\sum_{l=1}^{q}\delta_{l}Z_{i,l}
}
where \eqn{X_{i,t}=\sum_{j=1}^{N} W_{ij}Y_{j,t}} is the network effect, i.e. the weighted average impact of node \eqn{i}
connections, with the weights of the mean being \eqn{W_{ij}}, the single element of the network matrix \eqn{W}, and \eqn{I()} is the indicator function. The sequence \eqn{\lambda_{t}} is the expectation of \eqn{Y_{t}} conditional to its past values.

The null hypothesis of the test is defined as \eqn{H_{0}: \alpha_{0}=\alpha_{11}=...=\alpha_{2p}=0}, versus the alternative that at least one among \eqn{\alpha_{s,h}} is not \eqn{0}, for \eqn{s=0,1,2}. The test statistic has the form
\deqn{
LM(\gamma)=S^{'}(\hat{\theta},\gamma)\Sigma^{-1}(\hat{\theta},\gamma)S(\hat{\theta},\gamma)
}
where
\deqn{
S(\hat{\theta},\gamma)=\sum_{t=1}^{TT}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(\frac{Y_{i,t}}{\lambda_{i,t}(\hat{\theta},\gamma)}-1\right)\frac{\partial\lambda_{i,t}(\hat{\theta},\gamma)}{\partial\alpha}
}
is the partition of the quasi score related to the vector of non-linear parameters \eqn{\alpha=(\alpha_{0},...,\alpha_{2p})}, evaluated at the estimated parameters \eqn{\hat{\theta}} under the null assumption \eqn{H_{0}} (linear model) and \eqn{\Sigma(\hat{\theta},\gamma)} is the variance of \eqn{S(\hat{\theta},\gamma)}.

The optimization employes the Brent algorithm applied in the interval from \code{gama_L} to \code{gama_U}. To be sure that the global optimum is found, the optimization is performed at (\code{len}-1) consecutive equidistant sub-intervals and then the maximum over them is taken as global optimum.

The values of \code{gama_L} and \code{gama_U} are computed internally as the mean over \eqn{i=1,...,N} of \eqn{20\%} and \eqn{80\%} quantile of the empirical distribution of the network mean \eqn{X_{i,t}} for \eqn{t=1,...,TT}. In this way the optimization is performed for values of \eqn{\gamma} such that the indicator function \eqn{I(X_{i,t-d}\leq\gamma)} is not always close to 0 or 1. Alternatively, their value can be supplied by the user. For details see Armillotta and Fokianos (2022b, Sec. 4-5).
